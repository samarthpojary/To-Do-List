Excited to share my latest project - a clean, responsive todo application built with PHP, MySQL, and modern CSS. Here's what I built
âœ¨ Key Features:
User authentication (login/register) with secure password hashing
Clean, card-based UI with modern design principles
Responsive layout that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
Real-time task management (add, complete, delete)
Due date tracking for better task organization
Excel export functionality for data analysis
CSRF protection for enhanced security
